# Overview
A chatbot is a computer program that takes a text input, and returns a corresponding text output.

Chatbots use a special kind of computer program called a transformer, which is like its brain. Inside this brain, there is something called a language model (LLM), which helps the chatbot understand and generate human-like responses. It looks at lots of examples of human conversations it has seen before to help it respond in a way that makes sense.

By the end of this lab, you will understand:

- the main components of a chatbot
- what an LLM is
- how to choose an LLM for your application
- how a transformer essentially works
- how to feed input into a transformer (tokenization)
- how to program your own simple chatbot in Pythonide a spoken response
